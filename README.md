# particle_filter_project

**Team: Jason Lin and Adam Weider**

## Outline of components

### Initializing the particle cloud

- Implementation: Take `ParticleFilter.map.data`, filter out black (boundary) and gray (out of bounds) values, leaving only white (navigable space) values. Then, randomly select `ParticleFilter.num_particles` of these values with replacement. Create poses for the particles, using the indices of these values for their x and y positional coordinates, and random [0, 2π) z-axis rotations for their orientations. Use initial weights of 1.0.

- Testing: Copy the original `OccupancyGrid` and replace the white values with new values, whose black level increases with the number of particles at the corresponding position (white if 0 particles, light gray if 1 particle, etc). Use `map_saver` to visualize the grid as a `.pgm` file.

### Updating the particles based on robot movement

- Implementation: Subtract the positions and rotations of `ParticleFilter.odom_pose_last_motion_update` from those of `ParticleFilter.odom_pose` to obtain the linear and angular displacement of the robot. Apply these displacements to each of the particles. To check updated positions, perform a lookup in the `OccupancyGrid`: if the updated location corresponds to a black or gray value, then the particle has moved outside the navigable space. Possible responses include: 1) Lower (or zero) the weight of the particle; 2) Use the old position; 3) Find and apply the maximum possible displacement to the particle.

- Testing: Use the `matplotlib` package to visualize the particles before and after a motion update.

### Computing importance weights

- Implementation: Perform a raycast for each particle to determine the distances, in cells, to the nearest obstacles (black values) up to the search radius of the scanner (search radius of LiDAR divided by the cell resolution). [Details discussed here](https://theshoemaker.de/2016/02/ray-casting-in-2d-grids/) (possibly convoluted to implement, we might be over thinking this). Convert LiDAR scan distances to cells, and use the same weighting procedure from the class example (sum of differences).

- Testing: Test raycast operation with a single particle in a simple environment (no obstacles, single obstacle, one obstacle occluding another, etc) and verify the simulated scans. Then, test with many particles, and ensure that the highest weighted particles have a similar view to that of the robot.

### Normalizing importance weights

- Implementation: Sum the unnormalized weights and compute the reciprocal to find the normalization factor. Multiply all particle weights by this factor.

- Testing: Ensure there are no typos (we don't anticipate anything going seriously wrong).

### Resampling particles

- Implementation: Call `draw_random_sample` with the particle cloud as the elements from which to draw, the particle weights as the corresponding probabilities, and the number of particles as the number of samples to draw. Set the resulting sample as the particle cloud for the next iteration.

- Testing: Assuming `draw_random_sample` operates correctly, no testing should be necessary.

### Updating estimated robot pose

- Implementation: Compute the centroid of the particles to estimate position, and compute a weighted mean of their orientations to estimate rotation.

- Testing: Visually verify that the estimated pose converges on that of the robot (as the particles converge).

### Accounting for noise

- Implementation: Add noise to the distance measurements in the simulated particle scans.

- Testing: Observe how the simulated scan noise affects the performance of the filter. In response, tune the addition of noise to minimize time to convergence.
